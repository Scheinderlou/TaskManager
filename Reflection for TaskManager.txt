While making the Task Manager activity, I learned how to structure a React app using reusable components and props. I understood how state management works with useState to add, update, and delete tasks, as well as how useEffect, and parsing can save data to localStorage for persistence. 
I also realized the importance of styling and layout to make the interface user-friendly, but I only focus for a simplistic layout but readable and easy to use. Overall, this activity helped me practice React fundamentals and forging my practices in using the front end build tool Vite in a practical and interactive way.
